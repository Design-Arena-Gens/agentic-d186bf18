# Go To Market AI Agent

Agentic workspace that turns product context into positioning, messaging, channel motions, and execution backlog so AI products can reach the market with confidence.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to run the workspace locally.

## Core Flows

- Intake product signals (audience, problem, differentiation, pricing, tone, goals).
- Run the embedded GTM agent to synthesize launch phases, persona intelligence, messaging pillars, channel strategy, experiments, and measurement framework.
- Iterate on inputs and instantly compare blueprints to fine-tune the go-to-market motion.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build` – create a production build.
- `npm start` – run the production server.
- `npm run lint` – lint the project with the Next.js configuration.

## Deployment

Ready for Vercel deployment. After building locally, deploy with:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes --token $VERCEL_TOKEN --name agentic-d186bf18
```
